This is a straightforward but, oddly, difficult concept to put into
plain English.

To do so, we'll start by using the words <Required> and <Optional>.

Typically, in "normal" English, these are rather absolute terms.
However, in the discussion here, we have to introduce the relative 
meaning of those phrases as we apply them to the subject at hand.

That subject is "Variable Terms".  Here's one...

  H[elp]
  
This is a notational specification of the "Help" command.  The
part in the brackets is "optional", meaning you can specify it
or not.  In fact, we'll say the 'H' is <Required> and the
'elp' is <Optional>.  The brackets '[' and ']' indiate optional
parts of the command.

Fairly straightfoward so far.

But, let's pull a little trick and examine this one...

  [H[elp]]
  
Is the "H" now <Required> or <Optional>?  There lies the problem
with the two terms.

You could say "If the 'H' is specified, then the 'elp' is optional".

That's fair enough, but is the 'H' <Required> or not?  Or, is the 'elp'
just "more <Optional> than the 'H'"?

To make things worse, consider the following example...

  A[B[c]D[e[f][g]]
