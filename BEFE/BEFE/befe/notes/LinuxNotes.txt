NTFS...

Although it's really nice that Linux comes with NTFS file system drivers,
it's NOT nice that there's this weird behaviour...

  1) All Linux dirs/files show as mode 777, regardless of how they're
     set up with the security descriptors.  I guess they haven't quite
     got there yet.

  2) I think, since Linux is "case sensitive", you can make troubles
     if you make a file "temp.txt" and "TEMP.txt".  This will really
     throw Windows a wobbly.  Need to look into this.

...NTFS
