

Let us start with an excerpt from the Wikipedia page[1] describing
the origins of the phrase "Form Follows Function"...

    It was the American architect Louis Sullivan who coined the phrase
    "Form Follows Function", in his 1896 article «The Tall Office Building
    Artistically Considered»...

        It is the pervading law of all things organic and inorganic,
        Of all things physical and metaphysical,
        Of all things human and all things super-human,
        Of all true manifestations of the head,
        Of the heart, of the soul,
        That the life is recognizable in its expression,
        That form ever follows function. This is the law.[2]

    It was 'form follows function', as opposed to 'form follows precedent'.

That's the underlying priniciple behind the BEFE Software and it's design...

    Function trumps Precedent
    
We adhered to that underlying principle in our BEFE Software Library design,
not because we decided to "jump on the band wagon" but, instead, because
we have found from experience that NOT jumping on the established "band wagon"
often proves more useful than not.
