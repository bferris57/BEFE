This is a difficult one to express but here we go anyway...

Indexes are a numbering system, starting at zero, used to identify
elements in a sequence or array.

Typically, and for cultural reasons, increasing index numbers are
visualised graphically by extending to the right or down.

Hence...

  0: First item in list
  1: Second item in list
  ...
  
Or, given the sentence "the quick brown fox", it isn't difficult to
imagine "the" being word 0 in the list of words making the sentence
and "fox" being word 3 in the list.

The problem arises, however, when our cultural visual representations
and ideas of "left versus right" come head to head with the way
numbers are expressed, from right to left.

BLA BLA BLA

So, this leads to two important terms...

  <Index Numbering> convention
  <Significance Numbering> convention
  
<Index Numbering> convention is a "left to right" one.

The <Significance Numbering> convention is a "right to left" one.
