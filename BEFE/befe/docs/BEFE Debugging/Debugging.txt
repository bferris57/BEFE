This section discusses techniques for debugging BEFE using whatever environment
you happen to be using.

Since I can't possibly imagine what environment you have decided to use to
develop in/on BEFE or why you chose that environment, I can only discuss the
environment I'm using as a starting point.  

With this in mind, I'll tell you what environments I'm using for the initial
development of BEFE...

  o For operating systems...
  
    - Windows Vista 32 bit operating system (pay, Bloody Microsoft!)
  
  o For non source code text files...
  
    - Notepad++ (free, from notepad-plus-plus.org)
    
  o For source versioning control...
  
    - Tortoise SVN (free, from tortoisesvn.net)
    - Assembla SVN repository (free, single user version (bferris57) from www.assembla.com)

  o For C++ programming and debugging...

    - MinGW C/C++ headers and libraries (free, from sorceforge.net)
    - GNU C++ compiler (g++, not gcc) (comes with MinGW)
    - CodeLite IDE (free, from codelite.org)

  o For Java programming and debugging...
  
    - Eclipse (free, from eclipse.org, I think)
    
  o For Python programming and debugging
  
    - Python 3.1.2 (free, available www.python.org)
    
Right, now to get on with the debugging topics.  These are...

Sorry about the fact that there's only one topic at the moment but you have to start
somewhere, right?

Have fun!
