Re:   Report on the sample Library Application

I received the task instructions on 2/08/2012 around 12:00pm so
I rolled up my sleeves and started coding.

Since there were no specifics on what a "Library Application"
consists of, I focused on underlying data design and OO structure
to ensure that the data being manipulated was separate from the
Python implementation.

Since I tend to get into most projects quite deeply, I approached
it in the same way I would approach it had it been intended as a
"production application" and, since no UI interface was specified
I stuck to a command line based application to start with.

I had a lot of fun doing it so I spent a lot more hours on it (about
12 in total) than is absolutely necessary to show some of my Python
coding ability.  And, although it's not in the slightest finished, it
is starting to work and can be demonstrated on either Linux or Windows.

I have included the following files in the .ZIP attached to this
description...

  o _sample.txt   - Example input/output from running the application
  o libapp.py     - The Python command line processor (the "Application")
  o library.py    - The main Library class
  o libitems.py   - The LibItem and specialisation classes
  o liberrors.py  - Separating error message from error codes (for translation)
  o libutils.py   - Data validation utility functions
  
The main things to point out are that there's still plenty of bugs in it,
it's not at all fully documented, doesn't save/load any of the data to
a permanent store, and hasn't started to approach any multi-threading issues.

Other than that, all I can say is that with the 24 hours allotted to me,
that's about all I could accomplish so far.

Sincerely,
